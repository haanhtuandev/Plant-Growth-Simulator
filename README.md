# Virtual Greenhouse Simulator

## 🌿 Overview
The **Virtual Greenhouse Simulator** is an interactive web application that demonstrates the impact of environmental factors on plant growth. Users can adjust parameters **temperature and moisture** to observe the real-time growth of **trees**. This project combines **L-systems**, **smart farming concepts**, and **IoT-based simulations** to illustrate the relationship between climate and plant health.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Plant Growth Animation**: Visual representation of tree growth based on user-set conditions.
- **Adjustable Environmental Factors**: Temperature, moisture impact plant health.
- **Realistic Growth Simulation**: Trees bloom, thrive, or wither depending on optimal or poor conditions.
- **Smooth UI & Responsive Design**: Aesthetic and mobile-friendly interface.
- **No Registration Required**: Open for anyone to experiment with plant growth dynamics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (p5.js for animation)
- **Backend**: To be extended
- **Additional Tools**: L-systems for procedural growth simulation

## 🎨 UI Design
The simulator features a clean, aesthetic interface with:
- A control panel for adjusting environmental parameters.
- A **2D animated tree growth visualization** inside a well-styled container.
- Gradual visual effects for growth, wilting, or blooming.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Set environmental parameters** using sliders.
2. **Click 'Start Simulation'** to observe how the plant reacts.
3. The tree **grows healthily, blooms, or deteriorates** based on real-time calculations.
4. Experiment with different values to understand the impact of climate on plant development.

## 📂 Installation & Setup
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haanhtuandev/Plant-Growth-Simulator.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Ensure internet access for loading external libraries (p5.js).

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- **3D Visualization** using WebGL or Three.js.
- **Integration with IoT sensors** to simulate real-world farming conditions.
- **Expanded plant species** with different growth patterns.
- **User profiles** for saving and comparing multiple simulations.

## 🏆 Project Goals
This project aims to:
- Raise awareness of **climate’s role in agriculture**.
- Provide an **interactive and educational** tool for students and researchers.
- Explore the **potential for IoT-based smart farming applications**.
